## Overview

**DEMOdesign** is an R package implementing the **Dose Exploration, Monitoring, and Optimization (DEMO)** designâ€”a Bayesian adaptive Phase I/II trial framework tailored for oncology dose-finding, particularly for immunotherapies and targeted therapies. It selects an **Optimal Therapeutic Dose (OTD)** that maximizes **Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST)** while ensuring safety, biological activity, and clinical efficacy across three stages:

1. **Sequential Exploration**: Identifies safe, biologically active doses using biomarkers ($Y_B$) and toxicity ($Y_T$).
2. **Randomization and Monitoring**: Refines doses based on response ($Y_R$) and additional safety data.
3. **Randomized Optimization**: Selects the OTD using long-term survival ($Y_S$) via a Weibull model.

This package supports:

## Features

- **Three-Stage Bayesian Design**:
  - **Stage 1**: BOIN-based exploration with biomarker and toxicity screening.
  - **Stage 2**: Monitors admissible doses for efficacy and safety.
  - **Stage 3**: Optimizes dose selection with RMST.
- **Endpoints**: Integrates 
  - $Y_B$ (biomarker), 
  - $Y_T$ (toxicity), 
  - $Y_R$ (response), 
  - $Y_S$ (survival).

```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use DEMOdesign to simulate a Bayesian adaptive dose-finding trial.

``` r
library(DEMOdesign)

# Run DEMO_design with example data
result <- DEMO_design(seed = 1,
                      doses = c(0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.45, 0.65, 0.85),
                      Y_B_sim = c(2.00, 2.01, 2.08, 2.76, 3.75, 4.73),  # biomarker means
                      sigma2_B_sim = 1, 
                      Y_T_sim = c(0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.06, 0.13, 0.26),  # toxicity rates
                      Y_R_sim = c(0.04, 0.05, 0.08, 0.20, 0.35, 0.47),  # response rates
                      lambdaT_sim = c(0.8, 0.6, 0.6, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1),   # scale for Weibull survival
                      shape_sim = 1.5,      # Weibull shape parameter
                      delta1_sim = 3,       # effect of toxicity on survival
                      delta2_sim = -2,      # effect of response on survival
                      delta3_sim = 0,       # effect of biomarker on survival
                      censored_time = 24    # administrative censoring time 
                      )

# View the optimal therapeutic dose (OTD)
print(result$OTD)

# View summary of patient-level trial data
head(result$trial)
```

## Function Documentation

### DEMO_design()

#### Description
Implements a three-stage Bayesian adaptive design for Phase I/II oncology trials. It integrates biomarker ($Y_B$), toxicity ($Y_T$), response ($Y_R$), and survival ($Y_S$) outcomes to identify an Optimal Therapeutic Dose (OTD) that balances safety, efficacy, and long-term survival.

#### Inputs

- `seed`: Integer. Random seed for reproducibility.
- `doses`: Numeric vector. Dose levels to evaluate.
- `Y_B_sim`: Numeric vector. Mean biomarker values for each dose.
- `sigma2_B_sim`: Numeric. Variance of the biomarker outcome.
- `Y_T_sim`: Numeric vector. Toxicity probabilities for each dose.
- `Y_R_sim`: Numeric vector. Response probabilities for each dose.
- `lambdaT_sim`: Numeric vector. Weibull scale parameters for survival at each dose.
- `shape_sim`: Numeric. Weibull shape parameter.
- `delta1_sim`: Numeric. Effect of toxicity on survival time.
- `delta2_sim`: Numeric. Effect of response on survival time.
- `censored_time`: Numeric. Administrative censoring time (e.g., 24 months).

#### Returns

A list with the following elements:

- `OTD`: The selected Optimal Therapeutic Dose.
- `trial`: A data frame with patient-level trial data, including assigned dose, biomarker, toxicity, response, and survival outcomes.

### tau_ms()

#### Description
Estimates the lowest dose (\eqn{\tau_B}) at which biological activity (\eqn{Y_B}) increases significantly in a Phase I trial dataset. Uses a Bayesian model selection approach to compute posterior probabilities of step changes in \eqn{Y_B} across dose levels, returning the dose index where the step occurs or 1 if no significant step is detected based on a cutoff.

#### Inputs
- `dat`: Data frame. Phase I trial data with columns:
  - `d`: Numeric. Dose levels.
  - `Y_B`: Numeric. Biomarker outcomes.
- `monitor_cutoff_B`: Numeric. Threshold (e.g., 0.3) for the maximum posterior probability to declare a dose biologically active; if exceeded, returns the dose index, otherwise returns 1.
